 OTMB firmware
================================================================
Official firmware for the Optical Trigger MotherBoard (OTMB) for
the ME1/1 station of the CMS muon endcap detector.

This repository contains the source code and 4 ISE project files:
- otmb_virtex6.xise: Production, ISE 14.5
- otmb_preprod_145/otmb_prod_145.xise: Pre-production, ISE 14.5
- otmb_prod_124/otmb_prod_124.xise: Production, ISE 12.4
- otmb_preprod_124/otmb_prod_124.xise: Pre-production, ISE 12.4

The difference between production and pre-production firmware is
the .UCF file included in the project.
